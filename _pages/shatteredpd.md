Hey Look, Shattered Pixel Dungeon has a dedicated page now!

This page is currently **under construction**, eventually I would like to have a nice flashy splash page here, but for now all you get is the header image and some basic info:

Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a roguelike RPG for android, based on Pixel Dungeon! While it started as a project to improve on Pixel Dungeon's balance, it has since grown into a separate game, with the same core mechanics.

Some features are:
- **High replayability:** Randomly generated levels, enemies, and items. No two games are the same!
- **4 hero classes:** Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and Huntress. Each hero has a unique playstyle.
- **8 subclasses:** Successful heroes can refine their skills to become more powerful.
- **5 distinct dungeon regions:** each with their own enemies, traps, and quests.
- **Over 150 different items:** including powerful wands, rings, weapons, and armor.
- **50+ different enemies, 30 different traps, and 5 bosses** to test your skills.
- **Unique artifacts** which grow in power as you use them.
- **Updates** with new content roughly once a month.
