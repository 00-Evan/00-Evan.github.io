Hey Everyone, first update of 2019 and it's in March, whoops!

As mentioned in previous blogs, I am extremely busy with other work at the moment so unfortunately the first third of 2019 is ending up a bit sluggish. 0.7.3 will probably also come a bit slower and/or be a bit lighter on content, but I expect that things will start to pick up after April.

Anyway, delays or not, 0.7.2 is here! This update is focused on some major balance adjustments and quality of life improvements. Most notably, enchantments have been adjusted to be less about power and more about variety, and changes have been made to higher-tier alchemy recipes to make them much more flexible. I wrote a blog about both the [alchemy](/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-alchemy-streamlining.html) and [enchantment](/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-better-enchantment-balance.html) changes.

The update is rolling out to Google Play right now, and will be available to users on other platforms over the next couple days.

Hereâ€™s a heavily condensed changes list, you can find a fully detailed changes list ingame:

```
