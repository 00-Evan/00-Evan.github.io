title: Regarding Degradation
---
So degradation is pretty controversial, but I can appreciate why Watabou added it to the base game, [he wrote a blog on it which you should read.](http://pixeldungeon.tumblr.com/post/105009091675/on-the-latest-update)

That being said, I do agree it seems to damage the fun factor and that is what most people are complaining about (and some general imbalance too, but that’s easy to tweak away).

So when I’m looking to solve the problems degradation is attempting to solve, I have to ask if I can improve degradation as a system, or if I can solve the problem through something else entirely.

Honestly I don’t know the answer to that question, I’ll need time to think it over and weigh my options. I can certainly say though that I’m not just going to drop degradation into Shattered without evaluating and tweaking it, and gathering feedback from the community.
