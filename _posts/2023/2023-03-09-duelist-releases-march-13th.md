Hey Dungeoneers, the beta for v2.0 lasted a little longer than expected, but everything is now ready and I plan to release the update on **Monday, March 13th at 1pm EDT!**

I've been pretty regularly updating folks with beta progress on [![](/assets/images/mastodon-icon.png){: .rounded .text-inline} Mastodon](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@ShatteredPixel) and [![](/assets/images/twitter-icon.png){: .rounded .text-inline} Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ShatteredPixel), but thought it was a good idea to update everyone here as well.

Since the beta started exactly a month ago, I've filled out the Duelist's remaining subclass and armor ability, made some critical balance changes, fixed a ton of bugs, and am in the process of making a few final visual refinements before I submit v2.0 for approval to the game's various platforms.

Once v2.0 releases, Shattered will also be 25% off on Steam to celebrate. The sale will last for 10 days total, which includes Steam's regular spring sale event.
