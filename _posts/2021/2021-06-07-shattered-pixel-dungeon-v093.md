v0.9.3 redesigns hero armor abilities and adds a fourth tier to the talent system! There are 13 abilities and 40 new talents in total. There's also a new challenge, balance changes, bugfixes and various smaller tweaks.

I talked about this update in three previous blog posts:

## What's coming next?

The next update will be v0.9.4! v0.9.4 is going to be a variety update. There isn't a single major content focus, but there are a few different things to get excited about:

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-06-07/alchemy.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
Big alchemy improvements are still coming later, but In the meantime I'm making some smaller changes in v0.9.4. I want to make some recipes more worthwhile and add a few new ones that have a focus on improving inventory management. There are also some smaller interface tweaks I hope to make that will improve the current quickslot situation.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-06-07/music.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
One big addition in v0.9.4 will be a change to the game's music! I've been working with a composer, and for v0.9.4 I intend to roll out remasters of the game's current title and gameplay music. Expect to hear more about this in the future as well, replacing the two tracks is a good place to start, but we have plans to add several more!
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-06-07/apple.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
After teasing a bunch over the last couple months, I am finally moving forward on iOS! Expect a blog post sometime during v0.9.4's development that will detail things further. If all goes well, v0.9.4 will be the first update available to both Android and Apple devices!
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-06-07/new-player.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
If v0.9.4 will be available on iOS, I think it's an excellent time to make a few targeted tweaks to the new player experience. The current guidebook is too text-heavy and doesn't do the best job of giving you info right as you need it. I hope to improve this in v0.9.4, so that new players can spend a little less time wondering how the heck to fight sewer snakes.

I'm planning to write another blog post in 1-2 weeks that covers some technical changes coming in v0.9.4, and then more posts a bit later about some of the stuff coming in v0.9.4.
