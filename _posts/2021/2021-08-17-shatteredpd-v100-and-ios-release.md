![](/assets/images/icons/SHPD.png){: .align-left .rounded} [![](/assets/images//{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/appstore.png){: .align-right}](https://apps.apple.com/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109) Hey Dungeoneers, v1.0.0 has been released on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon), [the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109), and [GitHub](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/releases)! That's right, after seven years of development, we've hit v1.0.0, and [Shattered Pixel Dungeon is finally available for purchase on iOS!](https://apps.apple.com/app/shattered-pixel-dungeon/id1563121109)

## v1.0.0!

Yes, that's right, **the update previously named v0.9.4 is now the big v1.0.0!** Shattered is officially a released game, and I am confident in calling it a full experience, not just a work in progress!

<u><b>This does not mean I am finished making updates though!</b></u> I still have plenty of ideas, and have been receiving enough support to be able to develop the game for the foreseeable future.

This decision came a bit suddenly, as I only just discovered Shatteredâ€™s existing version naming scheme is incompatible with the App Store. Moving forward Shattered will use the industry standard `major.minor.patch` format instead, with 1.0.0 as a starting point.

It would have been nicer to have planned this from the start, but the more I think about it the more confident I am that this update deserves the v1.0.0 title. This is a huge milestone for Shattered with the release on iOS, new music, and the first time the game is being offered as a paid product! We're also releasing just a bit after Shattered's 7th birthday!

I am sorry that v1.0.0 ended up being fairly light on new content, but there will still be plenty of that to come in future updates.

## What's new in v1.0.0

v1.0.0 contains a variety of content additions and refinements. There is new music, support for new platforms, new alchemy recipes, and a few other odds and ends. I've also made a bunch of balance changes to hero abilities and various items.

I talked about this update in three previous blog posts:<br>
(Keep in mind that in these posts I call this update v0.9.4)

## What's coming next?

The next Shattered update will be v1.1.0, and will focus heavily on alchemy! I want to make alchemy more cohesive, simple, and make it better at recycling items the player doesn't want into items that they do want.

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-08-17/energy.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
The most major change will be an overhaul to how alchemy energy works. Currently energy sort of sits on top of the system and acts as a limiter on how much advanced alchemy a player can perform, but otherwise does nothing. I have some plans to make energy a much more integral part of the system, and for it to tie directly into recycling consumable items.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-08-17/alchemize.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
With alchemical energy changing, I'll naturally be looking at many of the game's higher end alchemy recipes as well! I can't promise that every single recipe will be perfect, but I hope to make some major changes in the next update that will substantially improve on many recipes.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-08-17/music.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
So far the early reception to the new music has been extremely positive! Kristjan and I are already working on some new tracks, and we might be ready to add more music in the next update. The current plan is to have a unique track for every region of the dungeon!
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-08-17/misc.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
Lastly, there will be some smaller miscellaneous changes v1.1.0 as well. I plan to continue keeping an eye on game balance and making tweaks to the new hero abilities added in the v0.9 updates. I might have enough time spare to rework an item or two as well!

Expect to hear more details about v1.1.0 in a future blog post, likely sometime in September. If you want faster updates about what I'm working on, [follow me on twitter!](https://twitter.com/ShatteredPixel) The micro-blog format of that website makes it perfect for giving quick project updates.
