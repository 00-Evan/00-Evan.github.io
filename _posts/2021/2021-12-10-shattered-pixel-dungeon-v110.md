## What's new in v1.1.0

v1.1.0 contains various improvements to the alchemy system and the items it produces, and a music track for each region of the game! There are a few new spells, and several buffs and reworks to exotic potions and scrolls in particular, and various other smaller changes.

I talked about this update in two previous blog posts:<br>

Here's a condensed runthrough of the major changes this update. You can check out the changes screen in-game for a fully detailed list.

## What's coming next?

The next Shattered update will be v1.2.0, and will focus on a variety of smaller improvements, including working on proper support for desktop users in anticipation of the game's upcoming Steam release. Unfortunately I'm spread a bit thin right now with Steam and real-life obligations, so v1.2.0 will be a light on content additions. I do hope to release it in less than 4 months though!

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-12-10/energy.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
v1.1.0 focused pretty heavily on the alchemy system itself and exotic potions/scrolls, but there are definitely improvements to be made to other alchemy items too! Once the dust has settled a bit from 1.1.0 I intend to do a full evaluation and balance pass on alchemy produce. That may mean some nerfs, but I expect the majority of item changes from this will be buffs.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-12-10/desktop.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
The other major focus for v1.2.0 will be new and enhanced features for desktop users! I wrote a blog post about this in detail already, but in summary I want to make it easier to install and run the desktop game, and improve the interface to better take advantage of mice and larger screens.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-12-10/music.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
v1.1.0 includes a bunch of new music, but Kristjan and I aren't finished yet! We're currently working on a boss track for Yog-Dzewa, and might add some music for the other bosses too.
</div>

<div style="display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 1.3em; width: 100%">
<p style="margin: 0px"><img src="/assets/images/2021/2021-12-10/misc.png" alt="" class="align-left"></p>
Lastly, there will be some smaller miscellaneous changes in v1.2.0 as well. Alchemy items will get the most adjustments, but I also plan to look into improvements to a few other items, such as the master thieves' armband. There will be the usual round of balance improvements too.

Expect to hear more details about v1.2.0 in a future news post, likely in January.
