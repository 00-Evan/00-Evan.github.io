I hope this is helpful for Shattered's Chinese playerbase in particular, who previously didn't have anywhere to officially download the game for Android.

**New Content**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Developer Commentary</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
- Released February 27th, 2025
- 197 days after Shattered v2.5.0
- 548 days after Shattered v2.0.0

Dev commentary will be added here in the future.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>The Cleric!</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**Shattered Pixel Dungeon has another new hero, making for six total!!**

The Cleric is an entire new hero class **with a variety of unique spells that they learn via talents!** They can be unlocked by removing the curse on any piece of equipment, but existing players who already have a win will automatically unlock them!

Much like how the Duelist can use a bunch of weapon abilities, I want the Cleric to be an ability-centric hero focused on Magic. Unlike the Duelist, these abilities are tied into the hero and their talents, instead of equipment items.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Cleric Subclasses</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**The Cleric has two subclasses, each with their own emphasis!**

**The Priest** is focused on ranged spell combat, effects that synergize with magical items like wands and artifacts.

**The Paladin** is focused on melee spell combat and defensive power. Their effects most strongly synergize with weapons and armor.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Cleric Armor Abilities</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**The Cleric has three lategame armor abilities as well!**

**Ascended Form** grants the Cleric access to new spells, extra attack ranged, and shielding whenever they cast spells.

**Trinity** lets the Cleric access the effects of items they've previously identified in their run without the items themselves.

**Power of Many** empowers or creates an ally for the Cleric, and grants them new spells to cast with that ally.

**Changes**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Visual & Interface Changes</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**Shattered's title graphic has been totally redrawn!** The new title graphic, by Aleksandar Komitov, improves on text quality and style while trying to stay true to the original title. There is now a landscape and portrait variant of this title as well.

The game's **Hero Splash Arts** have been improved as well! After so many years, Aleksandar has revised some of the game's hero splash arts to bring them up to his current standards:
- The Huntress and Rogue have recieved major changes
- The Mage has recieved moderate changes
- The Duelist has received only tiny tweaks to some face details.
- The Warrior's splash remains unchanged for the moment, but improvements to it are coming soon as well!

The **Games in Progress screen** has been expanded too, with up to 6 runs at once, info about recency, and sorting options.

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/buffs.png){: .align-center}
**Buffs**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Trinket Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
Overall trinket balance is in a much better place since v2.5, but there are still some that can do with being more powerful or fun to use:

- **Chaotic Censer** now only spawns gasses when enemies are present, and gives a warning one moment before the gas is spewed.
- **13 Leaf Clover** slightly redesigned, now has a 15% chance to set damage to max and 10% chance to set damage to min per level. This results in ~10% more average damage at +3.
- **Mimic Tooth** ebony mimics now have normal mimic stats, down from +25%, but still deal full damage on surprise attack.
- **Trap Mechanism** now also makes 10% of a level's traps spawn visible per level.
- **Shard of Oblivion** now prevents ID effects such as scroll of ID and wells of knowledge. Items are instead set to be ready to be IDed by the shard.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Weapon Ability Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
The Duelist continues to do better following all the changes in v2.X updates. A couple of weapon abilities are still lagging behind though, and so I'm giving them a little help:

- **Combo Strike** ability damage boost buffed by 25% for Gauntlets. 33% for Sai, 50% for Gloves.
- **Charged Shot** knockback +1, base bonus damage on untipped darts +1.
</blockquote></details></li>
</ul>

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/nerfs.png){: .align-center}
**Nerfs**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Trinket Nerfs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
Despite nerfs in v2.5 the Mossy Clump is still far and away the strongest trinket. For now I'm going to experiment with adjusting the ratios on the floors it grants.

- **Mossy Clump** now generates grassy floors 1/3 of the time and water floors 2/3 of the time, instead of 1/2 each. This will usually result in one fewer grassy floor over a whole run.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Shared Upgrades Nerf</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
Thrown weapons aren't an especially popular category of item to upgrade, and I would like to make more extensive changes to them in the future, but for the moment I'm making a targeted adjustment to the Shared Upgrades talent. The bonus damage it provided wasn't tied to the tier of thrown weapon used, which made T2 thrown weapons disproportionally powerful for the Sniper.

- **Shared Upgrades**  now grants 2.5%/5%/7.5% bonus damage per upgrade per tier, instead of a flat 10%/20%/30% bonus damage per upgrade. Functionally, this means -50% bonus dmg for T2 thrown weapons, -25% for T3, no changes for T4, and +25% for T5.
</blockquote></details></li>
</ul>

## What's coming next?

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/upcoming.png){: .align-center}

- The next major update to Shattered will be v3.1, which will mainly focus on followup to v3.0 and some changes to the Warrior!
- For a long while now the Warrior has been the least appreciated class among experienced players. This is partly intended because he is meant to be the most simple, but I do think there are some changes that can be made so that the Warrior's class ability is a bit more visible and interactive. This is not going to be a hero rework, but rather some targeted changes to improve the Warrior's game feel without making him much harder for new players to use.
- I'm more confident that the Cleric is releasing in a better initial state than the Duelist, but there will always be needed changes to balance or mechanics, and fixes for bugs. I expect to make those changes in v3.1 after taking a little time to gather feedback and gameplay data from v3.1.
- I want v3.1 to be a fairly lightweight update, so that it can come out quickly in response to v3.0, but there should be room for a few smaller changes too. In addition to the usual bugfixes and smaller QoL tweaks, I might add a couple of smaller content additions such as new trinkets and other items, a new rare enemy, etc.
- Unfortunately I will have to make some changes in 2025 that will remove support for very old devices from the game's iOS, Android, and plain Java versions. iOS 11 support is being dropped after this update, and Android 4.0-4.4 and Java 8-10 support will be dropped closer to the end of the year.

I expect v3.1 to be a relatively lightweight update, much like v2.1 was after the Duelist. v2.1 took almost 3 months, and while I'd like to do better than that I also don't want to end up overpromising. Hopefully you'll hear from me with progress on v3.1 sometime in mid April to mid May.

<u>Please keep in mind that while I always try to keep to the ETAs I provide, they are just estimates. If you don't hear from me by the ETA, it means I'm still busy with the update!</u>
