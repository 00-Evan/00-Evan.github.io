## Armor
Defensive players rejoice! Armor is now much more valuable, gaining significantly more power per upgrade, and reducing damage much more consistently. While armor still isn’t totally necessary, so players still have flexibility in their upgrade choice, those who invest a bunch in armor shouldn’t feel like they are picking the inferior option nearly as much.

## More Enemy Damage
So as to not make the game too easy, enemy damage is being adjusted to compensate for the armor changes. This most significantly effects lategame enemies, but earier foes are getting some adjustments too. Players who upgrade armor a bunch won’t notice too much of a difference, but those who go all-in on offense are gonig to feel the hurt!

## Wands
Wands are tricky to balance, I want them to be competitive to melee weapons, while not outpacing them, and also still being quite different and unique. Back in 0.3.0 I tried to rebalance wands, and while they were improved, clearly I didn’t give most wands enough power. That’s changing now, with most wands getting a nice boost to damage and improvements to their effects. Most notably, all wands now have damage which scales linearly, meaning that wands with small numbers of upgrades will deal considerably more damage than they used to. It’s now much more viable to spend a lot of upgrades on a wand, or just a couple.

## Evil Eyes
along with armor improvements, the lategame damage-dealer enemies known as evil eyes are getting a changeup too. It is now possible to evade their magical attacks, just like other magic based enemies. Eyes will now take a little time to charge up their deathgaze, giving you a chance to escape! Careful though, as taking the deathgaze hit will cause you much more damage than before!

## Keys and the UI
Keys now no longer exist in the inventory, but instead in the journal. The Ui at the top-right has been adjusted with this in mind, quickly showing you what keys you have, and also giving a convenient button to let you access your journal and catalogs. In addition to being more convenient, this change is paving the way for functionality to be added to the journal in the future.
