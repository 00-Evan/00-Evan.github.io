## Holy Changes Batman!
So in terms of gameplay impact this is easily the largest update shattered has seen yet, and there’s just far too much to cover everything here without taking up too much space.

To put things simply, this is my attempt to bring in the game pacing improvements that degradation brought to the vanilla game, without any of the downsides. The common strategy of hunting for high tier gear early and pumping everything into it is massively less viable now. Players should be much more encouraged to use a variety of items throughout their run, and there is a much greater variety of items and effects to choose from.

## More Forgiving Curses
A big part of these changes is to adjust how curses work to better encourage players to try on gear. Curses are no longer about game-endingly bad stats, but are instead about specific negative effects which can often be mitigated through smart play. As a tradeoff, curses are a lot ‘stickier’ now, so you’ll want to keep remove curse scrolls handly to reliably get rid of them.

## Easier, Harder?
With so much changing up, the state of the game’s difficulty is somewhat up in the air. Personally I think things are a tad harder, but only time will tell as players discover new strategies that work with all this new content. I’m going to keep a keen eye on things and make changes as needed.
