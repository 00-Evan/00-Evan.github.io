Hey Dungeoneers, I've got a small newspost for you today.

Over the last few updates Shattered's soundtrack has slowly grown from having just two tracks for the entire game to having an entire soundtrack with 20 minutes of combined audio! Now that Shattered has a proper soundtrack, it needs a proper release!

If you enjoy this new music, you can now [purchase it as a soundtrack on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1939650/Shattered_Pixel_Dungeon_Soundtrack/)! If you're not a Steam user, you can also purchase the Soundtrack from [Bandcamp](https://kristjanthomashaaristo.bandcamp.com/album/shattered-pixel-dungeoen). The soundtrack is also  available for streaming on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3dHngYgsOxqVLHqCGx545F?si=v9F1n8JjQlewZspwkUP2rA).

Finally, if you haven't purchased Shattered on Steam yet, You can [buy both the game and the soundtrack together at a slight discount](https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/25474/Shattered_Pixel_Dungeon_Game__Soundtrack/)! My apologies to Steam users who have already bought the game and would have preferred to grab the bundle. I originally planned to release the soundtrack at the same time as the game, but I ran into some logistical issues that held it up.

All revenue from soundtrack sales goes to its excellent composer, [Kristjan Thomas Haaristo](https://www.youtube.com/c/KristjanThomasHaaristo). We hope you enjoy it!

And that's all for now! Look forward to a blog post about the next game update toward the end of this month or in early May.

Lastly, while we don't have any active plans for more music yet, Shattered is always growing and there will definitely be opportunities for new music to be added to the soundtrack in the future.
