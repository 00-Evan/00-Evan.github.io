The next Shattered update will be v2.0.0, which is going to focus almost entirely on adding a new hero!

**The new hero in v2.0.0 will be the Duelist!** The duelist will be able to use weapons in ways other heroes cannot, through charge-based special abilities, and other mechanics via her talents and subclasses. Like all the other heroes, the duelist will have 2 subclasses, 3 armor abilities, and 26 talents!

I don't yet have any specific plans for other content in v2.0.0. I want to mostly focus on the Duelist, so don't expect as much side content as in previous updates, but I'm sure that there will be some amount of smaller additions and adjustments.

I was originally planning for the next update to be v1.5.0, and include a rework to the blacksmith's quest. We're now in the last quarter of 2022 though, and I suspect people would much rather see a new hero release next. I also heavily implied a new hero would come this year back in the 'Shattered Pixel Dungeon in 2022' blog post. This doesn't mean that the quest rework is never going to happen though, I'm just readjusting my priorities and will likely get to it in 2023 instead.

v2.0.0 will likely have a few blog posts as I make progress on implementing the new hero. Expect to see the first of those posts in November.
