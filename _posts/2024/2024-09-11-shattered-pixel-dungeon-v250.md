## What's new in v2.5.0

v2.5.0 includes a total overhaul to the journal, some new trinkets, and tonnes of smaller tweaks and balance changes. There are also new splash arts for each of the dungeons regions, viewable during loading screens! Be sure to check the changes screen for full details.

I talked about this update in two previous blog posts:
- [Coming Soon to Shattered: New Trinkets and Splash Art!](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-new-trinkets-and-splash-art.html)
- [Coming Soon to Shattered: A Journal Overhaul!](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-a-journal-overhaul.html)

Also, while not related to v2.5.0 in particular, Shattered celebrated its 10th anniversary last month, I wrote a blog post for that too, that includes an exciting teaser at the end:
- [Ten Years of Shattered Pixel Dungeon!](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/ten-years-of-shattered-pixel-dungeon.html)

Here's the full changelog for v2.5.0! Click or tap on each entry to read more. Note that this changelog will become slightly outdated as patches are released and dev commentary is added, so check the changes screen in-game for the most up to date version.

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/new.png){: .align-center}
**New Content:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Developer Commentary</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
- Released September 11th, 2024
- 119 days after Shattered v2.4.0

Dev commentary will be added here in the future
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Journal Overhaul!</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**The game's Journal interface has been completely overhauled!**

The Notes section has an entirely new grid-based UI with new icons, and **support for custom notes!** Custom notes feature user-enterable text and can be tied to a floor, specific item, item type, or just be plain text.

The Catalogs section has also been moved to a grid UI, and has been massively expanded with **almost 500 entries!** The catalogs now contain almost every item in the game, and a bestiary featuring almost every character, plant, and trap! There are also **9 new badges** which can be unlocked by filling the catalogs out!

You can also now **view badges directly from the journal**, both the ones for your current run and overall badges.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>New Trinkets!</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**Four new trinkets have been added!** Bringing the total to 15 trinkets.

The **Salt Cube** extends the duration that food keeps you full, but also reduces HP regeneration.

The **Vial of Blood** increases the healing granted by major healing sources, but also slows that healing down.

The **Shard of Oblivion** increases the amount of loot you'll find from enemies when you are wearing unidentified equipment.

The **Chaotic Censer** randomly spreads gasses nearby, that are harmful to you and to enemies.

There is also now a fourth 'random' option when selecting trinkets, if you don't want any of the first three.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Region Splash Arts!</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**New splash arts have been added to the game's loading screens!**

There's one for each of the five regions, once again made by Aleksandar Komitov!

Loading times have not been increased, but the first loading screen of each region now pauses to display that region's story text. This gives an opportunity to appreciate the art without making players wait longer on every loading screen. The game will even start panning the loading screen art during this pause for mobile portrait users!
</blockquote></details></li>
</ul>

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/changes.png){: .align-center}
**Changes:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Interface Improvements</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
In addition to the journal overhaul, there are several smaller UI changes and additions in this update too:

**Scrolls of Upgrade** now have a preview window that appears when they are used, that summarizes how the stats of an item will change when upgraded.

The main menu **Badges Screen** has been replaced with a new journal screen, containing the catalogs and guidebooks as well as unlocked badges.

The **Alchemy Screen** has been adjusted, primarily for desktop users. The guidebook button is now more visible, and shows the guidebook to the side when used on desktop.

The game now displays a little congratulations message after your first win, and clarity on what winning the game unlocks has been improved.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Cursed Wands</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
Cursed wand effects have been massively expanded! There are now 16 new effects bringing the total number of effects up to 32. These include simple common effects like shooting bubbles and new super rare effects like a giant supernova explosion!

A few existing cursed effects have also been changed:
- Reduced healing from the uncommon health transfer effect by 50%
- The uncommon 'shock and recharge' effect is now a lightning bolt, does more damage to a target and grants less wand recharge
- The rare inter-floor teleport effect now caps at sending the player back 10 floors
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Inventory Management Improvements</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
I've made various smaller changes to make inventory management a bit easier:

- The potion bandolier can now store the waterskin, and the scroll holder can now store arcane styli
- Converting a potion or scroll into alchemical energy now also identifies it
- Reduced the chance for multiple equipment drops from slimes, skeletons, guards, DM-200s, and golems

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/buffs.png){: .align-center}
**Buffs:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Trinket Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
I'm handing out buffs to several trinkets that are underperforming:

- **13 Leaf Clover** upgrade cost up, but it now only affect the hero's damage rolls. It no longer applies to armor or enemy attacks. This should preserve the intended chaos of the effect without making enemies way more dangerous.
- **Dimensional Sundial** upgrade cost up, but it now slightly reduces enemy spawn rates during daytime. 'nighttime' has also been adjusted to be 8pm-8am, from 9pm-7am.
- **Wondrous Resin**'s bonus cursed wand effects are now always neutral or positive.
- **Mimic Tooth** now boosts loot from all mimics.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Duelist Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
The Duelist is doing much better balance-wise since v2.4.0, but there are various specific abilities that are getting boosts this update:

Weapon Abilities:
- **Lunge, Cleave, Spike, Retribution, and Brawler's Stance** abilities all now deal more bonus damage
- **Crossbow's Charge Shot** ability can now also cause a melee attack to knock back, or an untipped dart attack to deal bonus damage. Tipped dart benefits unchanged.

Talents:
- **Liquid Evasion** talent evasion at +1 reduced to 3x from 4x, but the talent now also grants bonus accuracy on the next attack. 
- **Lethal Haste** talent now grants instant movement, instead of haste.
- **Swift Equip** talent's second use at +2 no longer has a 5 turn timer.
- **Deadly Followup** talent damage per level up to +10% from +8%.
- **Precise Assault** accuracy bonus increased to 2x/5x/inf., up from 2x/4x/8x.
- **Expose Weakness** talent now applies weakness as well as vulnerable.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Monk Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
v2.4.0's Duelist buffs were mainly focused on weapon abilities, which mainly benefit the Champion, so it makes sense that the Monk has fallen a little behind. I'm giving out several buffs and mechanics changes to boost the Monk back up, which should improve every ability she has, except meditate.

- Removed ability cooldowns entirely, except for flurry which has a 1 turn cooldown
- **Flurry** damage increased by 50%
- **Focus** now works on magic attack and has infinite duration
- **Dash** range increased by 33%
- **Dragon Kick** damage doubled

- **Unencumbered Spirit** energy gain changed to 50%/75%/100% from 40%/80%/120%
- **Combined Energy** is now more permissive and reduces charge use by 1, instead of 50%
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Other Buffs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
- **Wand Preservation** talent now always succeeds, no longer grants arcane resin on failure, and is limited to 1 use at +1, and 1 use per level at +2. 
- **Rogue's foresight** talent trigger chance increased to 75% at +1 and 100% at +2, up from 60% and 90%.
- **Hold Fast** talent now grants 1-2 armor per level, up from 0-2.

- **Ring of Energy** charge rate boost up to 17.5% per level, from 15%.
- **Unstable Brew** now guarantees an appropriate potion effect when thrown or drank, instead of making it more likely.
- **Unstable Spell** now guarantees an appropriate scroll effect based on nearby enemies, instead of making it more likely.
</blockquote></details></li>
</ul>

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/nerfs.png){: .align-center}
**Nerfs:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Bomb Identification</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
This is actually an exploit fix, but I'm listing the change here for clarity. Explosions will now avoid destroying any equipment, previously they would destroy un-upgraded equipment only. This led to some players purposefully blowing up un-identified items to see if they were upgraded.

I've been hesitant to change this functionality as I know it lessened inventory congestion, but after taking in feedback during the beta it's become clear to me that some players were relying on it to effectively avoid ever equipping unidentified items. Apologies for letting this persist for so long, I would have removed this exploit much sooner had I known how dependant some players were on it.

I am, however, considering some compensation changes to bombs (to make them more useful for their intended purpose), and to other items to lessen the risk of trying on unidentified gear a bit.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Grassy Floors</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
The Mossy Clump is still far and away the strongest trinket, despite several nerfs since adding it. At this point it's clear the value of that trinket is more reflective of how powerful grassy floors are, rather than the trinket itself.

So, I'm nerfing the drop-rate of dew from grassy floors by 50%, meaning that they will generate 2x as much dew as a regular floor on average, down from 4x. Seed drops from these floor are unaffected.

This reduces the bonus dew granted by the mossy clump by 67%, which should hopefully bring it more in-line with other trinket. I've also reduced the upgrade cost of the mossy clump to compensate.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Other Item Nerfs</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
- **Whip's Lash Ability** bonus damage reduced to 0%, from +20%. Ability still guarantees a hit on every target.

- **Ring of Haste** bonus speed per level reduced to 17.5% from 20%.

**Elixir of Featherfall** adjusted:
- Output quantity reduced to 1 from 2
- Recipe energy cost reduced to 10 from 16
- Falling into a chasm now reduces effect duration by 10 turns instead of ending it. Total duration unchanged at 50 turns.
</blockquote></details></li>
</ul>

## What's coming next?

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/upcoming.png){: .align-center}

- The next major update to Shattered will be v3.0.0, which will add the game's 6th hero: The Cleric!
- The Cleric is going to be a divine spellcaster who focuses on defense and utility magic that they access through a unique item! I expect them to contrast best with the mage, who's arcane magic abilities enhance the power of wands. I expect to share more details about the cleric in blog posts when v3.0.0 gets closer to releasing. Like all other heroes, the Cleric will have 2 subclasses, 3 armor abilities, and 26 talents!
- v3.0.0 is also likely to feature some visual improvements, potentially including some of what I've teased in the recent '[Ten Years of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/ten-years-of-shattered-pixel-dungeon.html)' blogpost, plus a few others I've not shared yet. Unfortunately the new art is still in the early stages, and so it's very hard for me to say where things will be when v3.0.0 releases, and what things in particular might be ready.
- As always there will be some smaller changes in v3.0.0 as well, including bugfixes and minor balance/mechanics tweaks. Given that v3.0.0 will take a while to make, I'll likely give v2.5.0 some bigger patches that usual, including any needed balance or mechanics tweaks that I don't want to delay into v3.0.0.

v2.0.0, which added the duelist, took about 5 months. While obviously I would like the update to release faster than that, I can't make any promises. I do expect to make some posts as development progresses though, so you should hear something from me about progress and design on the Cleric before the end of the year, ideally before December.

<u>Please keep in mind that while I always try to keep to the ETAs I provide, they are just estimates. If you don't hear from me by the ETA, it means I'm still busy with the update!</u>
