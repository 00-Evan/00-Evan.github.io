## What's new in v2.4.0

v2.4.0 features a new category of item: trinkets! They are more about tweaking gameplay variables than giving direct power or utility. There are also a bunch of smaller additions and tweaks, most notably to the Duelist and to Alchemy. Be sure to check the changes screen for full details.

I talked about this update in two previous blog posts:
- [Coming Soon to Shattered: Trinkets!](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/coming-soon-to-shattered-trinkets.html)
- [Status Update: v2.4.0](https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/status-update-v240.html)

Here's the full changelog for v2.4.0! Click or tap on each entry to read more. Note that this changelog may become slightly outdated as patches are released, so check the changes screen in-game for the most up to date version.

**New Content:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Developer Commentary</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
- Released May 15th, 2024
- 118 days after Shattered v2.3.0

Dev commentary will be added here in the future.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Trinkets!</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**A new category of item has been added: Trinkets!**

Trinkets are a new item type produced and upgraded via alchemical energy, and are more about tweaking gameplay variables than giving direct power or utility.

Look out for a trinket catalyst in the early stages of the game, which you can use at the first alchemy pot to produce one of three trinket options. There are **11 trinkets in total**.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>New Rooms</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**New standard rooms have been added to the various regions of the game!**

This includes one totally new room per region, and two new variants of entrance/exit rooms per region. Rooms that are mostly empty rectangles are now much less common, and there's a bunch of variety for which rooms can have entrance/exit stairs in them.

Entrance rooms are now also capable of merging with other rooms in a dungeon floor, but there are some guarantees so that enemies won't ever be near you right after descending to a new floor.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>More Holiday Items</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**I've added more holiday items for the rest of 2024!**

Expect to see some new temporary holiday overrides for cornish pasties for:
- Pride in late June
- Shattered's Birthday in early August
- Pixel Dungeon's Birthday in early December
- New Years in late December and early January

This is in addition to the usual pumpkin pie around Halloween and candy cane around the Winter Holidays.

...I may have also added a tiny little surprise for Rat King's birthday, but that won't appear until 2025.

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/changes.png){: .align-center}
**Changes:**
<ul>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Duelist Weapon Abilities</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
I'm making some overarching changes to the Duelist's weapon abilities, to make them stronger and feel more impactful:
- Weapon ability charge speed down by 33%
- Weapon ability charge cap reduced to 2-8, from 3-10
- Weapon abilities buffed across the board
- Some talents adjusted to account for weapon charges being less frequent
- Weapon abilities now directly state their damage ranges
Check the buffs and talent changes section for specific weapon ability and talent changes.

There are also some changes to the Champion subclass to go along with this:
- Champion's two weapons now share a charge count, but Champion gets boosted max charges and charge speed.
- Champion's secondary charge talent has been replaced with a new talent that encourages varied ability use.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Alchemy Changes</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
I've made a bunch of changes to the alchemy system to streamline things and complement the addition of trinkets:

- Catalysts have been removed entirely, recipes that required one now simply cost 8 or 9 more energy.
- A new unstable brew and spell have been added, which give random potion/scroll effects.
- Aqua Blast and Featherfall are now a brew and elixir, otherwise unchanged.
- High value potions/scrolls now grant a little more energy if they are energized.
- Alchemy pots now always spawn on the 3rd or 4th floor in each region.
- Various UI improvements have been made to the alchemy screen.

Various specific alchemy items have also received changes to their energy cost, output quantity, or mechanics. Check the buffs and nerfs section for more details on those.
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Talent changes</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
Duelist talents have been changed to account for adjustments to weapon charge mechanics:
- **Aggressive Barrier** shielding increased to 3/5 from 3, threshold changed to 50% from 40%/60%.
- **Focused Meal** charge boost reduced to 0.67/1 from 1/1.5.
- **Weapon Recharging** boost reduced to every 15/10 turns from every 10/6 turns.
- **Counter Ability** now grants up to 1.5 charges, instead of reducing cost.

I've made some changes meant to improve some of the least popular T1 talents:
- **Cached Rations** now awards a smaller number of unique 'supply rations'. These rations grant a little healing and cloak charge.
- **Test Subject and Tested Hypothesis** have been replaced with two new talents that grant small combat bonuses.

Plus one change to an unnecessarily complex T1 talent:
- **Hearty Meal** has been simplified, now just has one threshold at 30% HP
</blockquote></details></li>
<li><details markdown="1"><summary>Miscellaneous Changes</summary><blockquote markdown="1">
**Highlights:**
- Potion and Scroll talents can now trigger from elixirs, brews, and spells

**Misc:**

- Slight optimizations to memory use
- Improved the error message on Android when native code is missing
- Removed the power saver setting on Android 4.4+ devices, if the user hadn't already enabled it.
(Power saver was always meant for very old Android devices. It gives no real benefit for more modern ones.)

## What's coming next?

![](/assets/images/{{page.date|date:'%Y/%Y-%m-%d'}}/upcoming.png){: .align-center}

- The next update to Shattered will likely be v2.5.0, which will be a fairly small update focused on following up v2.4.0's changes and making some interface/QoL tweaks. 
- v2.4.0 ended up being a pretty massive update balance-wise, with a new item category and sweeping changes to both the Duelist and alchemy. More fine-tuned adjustment will definitely be needed once the dust settles a bit, and so I expect that will be an important aspect of both v2.5.0 and v2.4.0's patches. Ideally most of the followup changes will be buffs, but we'll have to see how everything shapes up.
- Given that v2.5.0 won't have a new content focus, I'd also like to take the chance to make some smaller interface-driven changes that players have been asking me for. I can't guarantee what will be in v2.5.0 specifically yet, but frequent requests include better journal functionality (landmarks, catalogs, notes, etc.), a bestiary, and better support for controller users and keyboard users.
- The next major content addition I have planned is the Cleric, coming in v3.0.0. While I do think it's a good idea to do a small v2.5.0 update first, I will start actively designing the cleric now behind the scenes, so keep your eyes peeled for info on that as well!

I expect v2.5.0 will have a shorter dev time than usual, what with it being more about smaller changes. Hopefully things will have shaped up enough for me to make a blog post about it and commit to a release date sometime in July. <u>Please keep in mind that while I always try to keep to the ETAs I provide, they are just estimates. If you don't hear from me by the ETA, it means I'm still busy with the update!</u>
